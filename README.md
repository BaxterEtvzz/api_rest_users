# Rest API User

This project involves developing a REST API for user management in accordance with the challenge specifications. The API interects with a MongoDB database for data management and also consumes the Studio Ghibli API, depending on the users's role.
-It's essential to provide your IP address for MongoDB network access. Once your IP is registered, you can proceed with the installation process.-

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Or

```bash

```
If you encounter an error such as 'ERROR: Could not install packages due to an OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:'

please install the following dependencies, using the provided commands ðŸ¥²:

```
Alternatively, use:
```bash
pip3 install fastapi
pip3 install "uvicorn[standard]"

```

## Usage
